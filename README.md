Development setup
-----------------

The App is developed using Android Studio and should pretty much work out-of-the-box when you clone
the Git repository and open the project with Android Studio.

The only exception is that you need to obtain some free API keys for the different data sources that
EVMap uses and put them into the app in the form of a resource file called `apikeys.xml` under
`app/src/main/res/values`. You can find more information on which API keys are necessary for which
features and how they can be obtained in our [documentation page](doc/api_keys.md).

There are two different build flavors, `google` and `foss`, where only the `google` variant uses
Google Maps data and provides the Android Auto integration. The `foss` variant only uses Mapbox data
and should run on devices without Google Play Services.

We also have a special [documentation page](doc/android_auto.md) on how to test the Android Auto
app.
